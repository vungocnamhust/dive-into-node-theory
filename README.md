## Why I do this project?
-  When I wrote some codes, I could not understand how it works and it made me extremely disturb. Therefore, I decide to explore how my code work deeply

## What I gain from this project?
- I realized that every framework was made through thousands of developers and experts. Therefore, if I try to understand all, it is impossible.
- I will keep my spirit of finding everything deeply, and the level of depth depend on how necessary it is.
